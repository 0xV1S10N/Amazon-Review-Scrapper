"5.0 out of 5 stars Elevating My Competitive Edge in Warzone: A Razer Viper Ultimate Review","As a daily Call of Duty Warzone player and a competitive gamer, finding the right peripherals that match my high standards and intense gameplay requirements is crucial. The Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse, with its RGB Charging Dock, has not only met but exceeded my expectations, becoming a pivotal tool in my gaming arsenal. Precision and Responsiveness: In the fast-paced, high-stakes environment of Warzone, every millisecond counts. The Viper Ultimate's 20K DPI optical sensor and the fastest gaming mouse switches have provided me with the precision and responsiveness I need to make split-second decisions and execute them flawlessly. The optical switches are a standout, ensuring that every click is registered instantly without any latency, a critical factor in competitive gaming where every action can be the difference between victory and defeat. Ergonomics and Comfort: For someone who spends hours daily on Warzone, the design and comfort of a mouse are paramount. The Viper Ultimate's lightweight design and ambidextrous shape have been ideal for my hand size, offering a perfect balance between comfort and control. The mouse's dimensions allow for easy maneuverability without causing fatigue, making it suitable for extended gaming sessions. This balance is particularly beneficial in a game like Warzone, where quick movements and endurance are key. Wireless Performance and Battery Life: Initially, I was skeptical about switching to a wireless mouse for competitive gaming. However, the Viper Ultimate has dispelled all my doubts with its hyperspeed wireless connectivity, which has been as reliable and fast as a wired connection. The 70-hour battery life ensures that I'm never left hanging in the middle of a match, and the convenient RGB charging dock not only keeps my mouse charged but also adds a stylish flair to my gaming setup. Customization and Software: Tailoring the mouse to fit my gaming style has been a breeze with Razer Synapse. Disabling the ambidextrous side buttons to avoid accidental presses during intense Warzone matches was simple, and adjusting the DPI settings to match my gameplay has given me an edge over my competitors. The ability to store profiles directly on the mouse is a bonus, allowing me to maintain my settings regardless of where I'm playing. Overall Experience: Transitioning to the Razer Viper Ultimate has been a game-changer for my competitive play in Call of Duty Warzone. Its impeccable performance, combined with the lightweight design and reliable wireless connectivity, has not just enhanced my gameplay but also my overall gaming experience.

This mouse has not only met my rigorous demands but has also contributed to elevating my gameplay to new heights. For any serious gamer looking to enhance their performance in Call of Duty Warzone or any other competitive title, I cannot recommend the Razer Viper Ultimate enough.","04 Mar 2024","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tf2GvGbRL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Irakli T.","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars The First Razer Product I Like!","I have purchased Razer mice in the past and have never liked the way they felt in my hand.  This mouse however, feels great and I love it.  I bought this to replace my Glorious Model O mouse because I wanted to go wireless.  It's amazing that this wireless mouse is only about 6 grams heavier than the Model O and it doesn't even need to have the hexagonal pattern on the case to remove weight. I spend a lot of time in first-person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege and Battlefield when I'm not at my desktop doing normal daily web browsing and email reading. Here are some pros: - Feels very light, especially for a wireless mouse. - I don't sense any delay, even after I leave it sitting for a while. - It's very convenient to have a power button on the bottom of the mouse, and to have a charging dock to sit it on when not in use. - The button clicks are very satisfying - good sound, good force needed (not too much or too little for my taste). - Lighting is tasteful and not too overdone. - The finish on the mouse is nice to the touch - grippy on the sides, and smoothly textured elsewhere. - The side buttons are well-placed for my thumb.  Others have been a little too far forward for me. - The battery life seems great. I am part-way through my fifth day of use and the battery is at 51%.  I have been using it to play games every day for at least 3-5 hours per night plus regular Desktop duties for at least an hour each day as well.  I have not recharged it yet and I turn off the power at the end of each day when I am done with the mouse for the night. - The Synapse software is much better than I expected and has not crashed for me once.  It's pretty easy to understand and laid out fairly well.  It's great that it will change profiles for me automatically based on the games I start up, then go back to my ""desktop"" profile after I close the game. Here are some cons (for mouse, and Synapse software): - I miss the extra button on top of the mouse that my Model O had.  I wish this mouse had that extra button near the scroll wheel.  I have had to use one of the right-side buttons instead.  Although the right-side buttons are not as easy to press for me (since I'm a right-handed user) I'm getting used to them for desktop use. - I find the lighting options a bit confusing with regards to the ""Quick"" effects and the ""Advanced"" effects in the Synapse software.  Mostly, it's frustrating that only the Quick effects are stored on the mouse with the profiles and not the Advanced effects.  I think this means that if you want to use any of the Advanced effects, they will not be saved on the mouse and I'm not sure if they can be tied to games like the other profiles.  Before I can really fault the mouse or software for this one, I suppose I need to learn how to use it more.  Either way, I wish it were a little simpler to understand for first-time Synapse users like me. - I wish the mouse feet were ""slipperier"".  Compared to my Model O mouse, this mouse does not move across my cloth mouse mat as easily.  My no means is it ""not"" slippery, but it was noticeably less slippery when I was swapping them out.  Now that I have not used my Model O for about 5 days, I don't notice it any more or have any issues moving the mouse, but it would be nice to know that it was at least as free to move as the Model O.  This might turn into a plus as I get used to it because it may give me a little more ""control"". To summarize, I love this mouse!  It's been great to use so far and I'm very glad I switched back to this wireless option.  Lot's to like here and the software (despite some shortcomings) is much better than I expected and seems mostly mature and works well.","09 Aug 2020","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","","Yes","Jason","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable Mouse","I use this as my everyday mouse, I don’t do PC gaming, but am aware of RAZER in the industry and its reputation for quality. This mouse is great. It is lightweight and the battery last a really long time and it conserves power when not in use, I’ve left it on and off the charger for 2 days straight and it still had enough juice to last the rest of the next day. The dock is really nice and I like that it recognizes the dongle in the dock so it only takes up one USB slot for the entire assembly. I also enjoy the LED light show that both the dock and mouse display when in use.","25 Jun 2024","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619k3m4nYnL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Matt","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"4.0 out of 5 stars Great mouse, one caveat! - Updated","I’ve purchased many Razer products, and from my experience with Razer, every single product I had had some sort of fatal problem eventually, with normal use. I decided to give them one last chance because I do love their Synapse program where you have control over everything, and they are actually stylish and relatively good quality products. This Wireless Viper Ultimate is lightweight, very responsive, and has very low delay. It feels good in the hand, and the left and right clicks need just the perfect force to click. Some of their other mice give you the option to change the force needed to click, so given that this one doesn’t, they have it set in a sweets spot. One thing I love about the mouse is that the USB receiver can be plugged directly into the charging dock, so you don’t need 2 USB slots on your computer I/O for the charging dock, and the USB receiver. The mouse is white, so I’m not sure if it will get discolored and rub off with time. It feels good in the hand, but I have one (avoidable) issue, and that is this mouse is made for both hands, it’s symmetrical, meaning that the side buttons are on the left, and the right side. I noticed that specially while gaming, it’s so easy to click one of the 2 side buttons by mistake with your pinky or ring finger. My solution was to disable them from Razer Synapse, but it would have been nice to still have those extra buttons put in a way where both left handed and right handed people can use them without making unintentional clicks. The other minor thing is that the sensitivity adjustment button is located under the mouse, and no longer behind the scroll wheel like all their other mice, meaning you can not control the sensitivity on the go while playing an FPS game for example, you’d have to flip it around and cycle through them one by one. It does have an LED indicator to let you know which sensitivity you’re on though. They are determined in Razer Synapse. Battery life is OK, holds a charge for a couple of days with heavy use. Overall, good mouse right out the box. I will be happy if this one holds better than the previous ones. Still rooting for Razer! UPDATE: Dropped to 4 stars. Months into using this mouse, and as expected, an issue magically appears as with most Razer products! The mouse will not charge when placed on the dock if the mouse goes below 5%. If it's not low in battery and you attempt to charge it it works just fine. I'm not sure if that's a software bug, but it's definitely annoying having to go back and forth between wired and wireless. You naturally charge the mouse when you get prompted that it's low in battery, but by that time it's too late.","08 Jan 2024","Color: Mercury White Style: Mouse + Dock","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sHjj0E8fL._SY88.jpg

"5.0 out of 5 stars Unleashing Gaming Excellence","he Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse, paired with its RGB Charging Dock, has undoubtedly raised the bar for my gaming experience. As an avid gamer, I've been on the hunt for a mouse that combines precision, speed, and wireless convenience, and Razer has delivered all that and more. The first thing that caught my attention was the mouse's lightweight design. It's incredibly comfortable to hold, and the ambidextrous shape ensures a perfect fit for both left and right-handed gamers. The smooth, matte texture provides a secure grip, and I never experience hand fatigue even during marathon gaming sessions. The Hyperspeed wireless technology is a game-changer! The mouse boasts an almost imperceptible 1ms response time, which translates into instantaneous and lag-free movements. Gone are the days of being tethered by a cable – the wireless freedom enhances my gameplay and gives me a competitive edge. The Razer Viper Ultimate's optical sensor is nothing short of exceptional. With a DPI range of up to 20,000, I can customize the sensitivity to suit any gaming scenario. Whether I'm sniping from afar or engaging in fast-paced action, the mouse's accuracy ensures every movement is smooth and precise. The dedicated DPI clutch is a brilliant addition. By holding it, I can temporarily lower the DPI for those precise shots, making it a lifesaver in intense gaming situations. The RGB lighting is not just for aesthetics; it's customizable to indicate the battery level, which is incredibly convenient. Speaking of which, the battery life is outstanding. The Viper Ultimate lasts for hours of continuous gaming, and when it's time to recharge, the included RGB Charging Dock makes it effortless and looks fantastic on my gaming setup. The programmable buttons are easily configurable through Razer Synapse, providing endless customization options. Creating and saving profiles for different games or genres has never been simpler. In addition to its gaming prowess, the Razer Viper Ultimate is versatile enough for everyday use. The precision and responsiveness carry over to everyday tasks, making it a reliable companion for work and productivity. In conclusion, the Razer Viper Ultimate Hyperspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse, along with the RGB Charging Dock, has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Its lightweight design, hyperspeed wireless technology, and customizable features make it the ultimate gaming mouse. I couldn't be happier with my purchase from Amazon, and I highly recommend the Razer Viper Ultimate to any serious gamer seeking a top-tier gaming mouse that delivers on every promise.","19 Jul 2023","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Viper Ultimate WINS vs. Logitech G903","I've owned both, and wanted to share some insights that I would have liked to have known before laying down this kind of cash for a mouse: Right off the bat, I need to say that the G903 is an excellent mouse but has a massive, fatal flaw: Logitech refuses to source an alternative to the frequently defective switches in its primary buttons.  If you google 'G903 double click issues,' you will find that these switches fail at an alarming rate.  This happened to me, after around 14mos for the original, 10mos. for the replacement under warranty.  Logitech refused to replace the replacement.  I consider this failure rate completely unacceptable for a ""premium"" mouse. My last mouse is 5+ years old and still going strong; I'm only switching because I wanted to go wireless. Personally, I will likely not trust Logitech for some time.  If you're willing to take the risk, see below for a comparison. Performance Both of these mice are incredibly responsive.  I would be hard pressed to tell the difference between wired and wireless modes on either mouse.  Both sensors are excellent and perform well on all surfaces.  Both of the mice have 5 steps of mouse sensitivity that can be individually modified by the user in the mouse software.  I love this.  The G903 has two dedicated buttons on the top of the mouse to move up and down between these sensitivity steps, which is much more convenient than the Viper's single button located on the underside of the mouse.  I assigned one of the Viper's side buttons for this, but it's not as convenient. Ergonomics: Both of these mice are ambidextrous.  (I'm left handed.)  The G903's larger size and rounder shape is probably best suited for a palm grip, but I use a claw grip and was totally fine.  The main thing is the G903 is a large mouse.  People with smaller hands will likely find this mouse cumbersome.  I slightly prefer the G903's side buttons, which protrude further than the Viper's which makes them a little easier to click, but this will be very subjective.  The Viper is a little flatter, a little narrower, and a little shorter, and the form factor a little better for my medium sized hands. It's also a lot lighter. The G903 does have customizable weights, although I don't really see the necessity of this. Battery Life: The Viper is rated to have a much longer battery life than the G903, but I found myself charging both of these mice every 3-5 days or so, depending on computer use.  The Viper does have the option to come with a dock, which I find convenient.  However, the USB connection, though standard, is hidden in an extremely narrow cutout that most generic cables will not fit in.  The G903 has a mousepad that lets you charge as you play, which is a cool idea, but it's expensive and really, as long as a mouse lasts a full day it's not that hard to charge at night. Wow, that was a long review.  Never done one that long before.  I just spent a ton of time researching and a ton of money buying these two mice, so thought I'd try to share some of that.","03 Apr 2020","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","","Yes","Y Marcus","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"5.0 out of 5 stars Razer is really stepping up their mouse game","I wanted to try different mice after using a Logitech G502 lightspeed for a long time. While my G502 lightspeed is by no means a terrible mouse, I wanted something that weighed less and I wanted to try out different mice shapes. After hearing many praises for the Viper Ultimate, I decided to try it out myself to see if the hype was worth it or if it was all marketing nonsense. First off this is an ambidextrous mouse. I am a right handed user  and I mainly play with palm/claw grip sometimes transitioning to full palm and full claw grip. The rubber texturing on the sides and its shape makes it super comfortable to use and I have medium sized hands. On top of that, it is really lightweight. The charging dock is an absolute genius idea I wish other big companies would start adopting. You simply plug the dock into your PC, then plug the receiver on the spare usb port on the dock, and when you need to charge your mouse just put it on the dock. If you need to charge it in a pinch, take the usb cable out of the dock and plug it directly into the mouse. Next let's talk about build quality. And boy did Razer deliver. No signs of creaks, has a really solid feel, materials don't feel cheap, and the left/right clicks have really nice texturing on them. Left and right clicks may feel a little off at first if you are coming from mice that have extremely tactile and distinct clicks. That's because they are using optical switches and you may or may not like how they feel but I got used to them pretty quickly. The side buttons however have a really nice tactile feel and despite being an ambidextrous mouse, as a right handed user I never accidently bumped into the side buttons on the right hand side of the mouse. Razer really nailed the side button positioning such that they can't be accidently activated (at least in my opinion). Wireless performance is on par with my G502 lightspeed. No noticeable delays, weird connectivity issues, or any funny business. Battery life is also really good. I usually disable RGB and that really helps with battery life. Sadly I've only had my mouse for a few days so I can't fully test battery life claims. TLDR: An awesome mouse that won't disappoint. I recommend getting the dock combo to get the full experience. I mean, might as well if you're going to drop big money on a wireless mice anyways. I see no reason not to.","20 Jan 2021","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gWuiOHu0L._SY88.jpg

"5.0 out of 5 stars Wireless King, but I wouldn't pay full price for it","Edit: 2 Year Update: As of currently, July 2023, I have been daily driving this mouse for over 2 years. It is still going strong. The optical switches are still the most reliable and responsive switches I have ever used. Even after millions of clicks and hardcore daily usage, this thing is as reliable as the day I got it. I can count on it to make clicks exactly when I intended to, never double clicking and never false triggering. Gamers know just how important this is. Battery still easily lasts for 2 days with constant usage and RGB brightness at the default 30%. Aside from the textures on the sidegrips having been worn completely smooth where the tip of my thumb rests and some discoloration of the skates, you practically cannot tell that this mouse has ever been used. I did run into a bit of trouble with the middle click requiring harder presses to register at one point. However, all I had to do was bang the mouse a couple times on the side against my mousepad and blow on the scroll wheel with pressurized air, and it has been working normally again ever since. Truly, nothing can faze this mouse. Of course, I should address that during those 2 years, Razer has updated the Viper series. To put it bluntly, the Viper V2 Pro is not worth it at all unless you value a 16g lighter weight over absolutely everything, on a mouse that is already extremely light. The V2 Pro lacks tons of features including side buttons on both sides, docked charging, and RGB. It also has a smaller battery. With this original Razer Viper Ultimate practically being permanently on sale now (being a ""previous generation"" mouse), it just has too much value over the new Viper V2 Pro, making the decision a no-brainer. In 2023, this is still the greatest mouse I have ever used, hands down. I still find it extremely comfortable in my hands. And there is no greater feeling than to know that I can always rely on this mouse to do exactly what I want it to do, 100% of the time. Razer, you'll have to do WAY better than the Viper V2 Pro to beat this Viper Ultimate. (P.S., Synapse is still terrible. It has no problems switching profiles anymore, but now it will occasionally go crazy with the CPU usage.) _____________________________________________ Original Review: To preface - I find it very difficult to find a mouse shape that is comfortable for me.  My hands are roughly 19x10 cm and I use a full palm grip. My favorite mouse in terms of comfort is the Corsair Nightsword, followed by the Corsair M65. I also owned the Razer Basilisk, which is comfortable at first, but starts to cramp my hand with extended use. I have long been searching for a proper wireless mouse with a good RELIABLE connection, rechargeability/good battery life, a reasonable price, and of course above all, a good shape. It's no secret that the Viper Ultimate and the G Pro Wireless have been hailed as the best wireless mice around, but the price always kept me away from giving them a shot. Plus, I had heard about double click issues with the G Pro and the shape looked too ambidextrous for me. The more contoured shape of the Viper Ultimate and its optical switches caught my eye more. So when Prime Day came around and I saw the mouse + dock combo at $89.99, I jumped at the opportunity. (I would definitely not recommend paying $150 or even $120 for any mouse, it just isn't worth it.) Shape: 9/10 I was scared of this the most since very few mice are comfortable to me. But when I started using the mouse, it felt great, to my surprise. Sure, the hump is a lower than I would have preferred, but my hand can rest very naturally on it with no cramping or fatigue. The low profile and relative lack of contours on the side make it slightly hard to pick up without it feeling like it's slipping out of your hand, but the incredibly light weight certainly makes up for it a bit. I didn't give it a 10/10 because for me, it still isn't as comfortable as the Corsair Nightsword (which feels like it was practically molded for my hand). Overall though, very comfortable and I plan to use it as my main mouse. Buttons: 9/10 The main buttons are a 10/10 for me (Left click, Right click, and Scroll Wheel/Middle Click). They feel crisp and snappy with just enough feedback. I can definitely notice the optical switches. Every click feels EXTREMELY fast and responsive, but not in an oversensitive type of way. I use a mechanical keyboard with optical switches, and that has held up very well with 0 misfires or double-presses, so I am hoping for the same from this mouse. Every one of my mice with standard mechanical switches has ended up double clicking after some time and having to get replaced. My only problem with this mouse's buttons are the side buttons. They are way too recessed in the mouse (almost flush with the body) and I would definitely prefer them to stick out a bit more. Aside from that the buttons are very well built, with 0 wobble and a nice click. Software: 3/10 Sorry Razer, but synapse just sucks. (Take some notes from Corsair please). The profile switching for recognizing different programs is extremely slow, causes the mouse to freeze up for a few seconds, and can even ""crash"" the mouse and require it to be turned on and off again. Apparently some other uses said this is because Synapse literally uploads the new profile to the mouse every time you switch programs, which is a terrible design. There IS a workaround, made possible by the fact that this mouse has on-board storage. Store the profiles you are using on the mouse's on-board storage, and you can use it without a hitch. However, this is really no excuse for Synapse to suck as there are plenty of other Razer mice that do not have on-board storage. The other big problem with Synapse is that macros do not immediately stop after you release a button - they will continue playing to completion. This severely limits the number of applications where you would choose to use a macro as this makes it too unsafe to use in many situations. Wireless: 10/10 (With the workaround stated above) Great connectivity - extremely reliable and responsive, as long as you use the workaround for Synapse. Switching profiles without the workaround was the only time the mouse would ever hiccup/disconnect. With the work around, it is just as reliable as a wired connection. And when the mouse goes into ""sleep"" mode, I hardly notice a delay when I wake it up. Sensor: 10/10 Great sensor, combined with the low weight and low-friction gliding feet the tracking is silky smooth. Lift off distance is extremely low as well and can be further adjusted in Synapse. Weight: 10/10 Extremely light. Do I sometimes miss having a sniper button to lower my DPI? Sure. But do I need it with such a light mouse? Certainly not. Any small micro-movements are extremely easy to make and it requires little to no-effort to move this mouse. Battery Life: 10/10 I've been using this mouse with the default setting of 33% RGB brightness, and when I'm actively using the mouse at the computer for the whole day (12+ hours), it barely goes down to 70%. For less intensive use, you might last a whole 5 days without charging, or even a whole week. If you turn off the RGB, you could go for even longer. _____________________________________________ Final remarks: While the shape doesn't quite reach the 10/10 comfort that the Corsair Nightsword is for me, it is still extremely comfortable at a 9/10. Had I not experienced the Nightsword, I might have rated this a 10/10. It is comfortable enough that, combined with being wireless and having optical switches, I am completely sold on it. It is now my new primary mouse. The buttons are great, and I have high hopes for the reliability of the optical switches as Razer is the mouse maker currently using them. Wireless connectivity and and battery life are amazing. Synapse is the only thing that sucks. Razer please fix the software - it's borderline a dealbreaker that makes me reluctant to ever consider Razer products. If you ever see this mouse on sale, I highly recommend it. Just don't ever pay more than $100 for a mouse unless it was signed by Bob Ross.","26 Jun 2021","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GylRA4vEL._SY88.jpg

"5.0 out of 5 stars Lighter and nicer to use than expected","I've been using Razer products for a number of years, in particular mice.  This is hands down the best Razer mouse I've used so far and possibly the best mouse I've used as well.  I haven't been on the bandwagon for lighter and lighter weight mice.  Now I might have to jump on that train because the Viper Ultimate is so shockingly light I have a hard time believing that it still works.  Previously I had the Razer Taipan and perceptually it's about 2.5 times heavier.  The transition over has taken a bit of time to get used to but I do like it.  It does feel like you can rapidly change the direction the mouse is moving without much effort and it could lead to better performance playing shooters in particular. Both the Taipan and the Viper Ultimate have rubber grips on the sides of the mouse, and I think It's a really nice feature of both.  I've used wireless mice in the past, a Microsoft one that failed me several times in the heat of battle that used AAA batteries.  I was really unsure about using a wireless mouse again but I figured it was about time to try one again, possibly the technology has improved over the years and certainly it has.  I was tempted by the Razer Orochi v2 but I didn't want to be buying batteries over and over.  I think the Viper Ultimate is a bit better for my personal preferences and I really do like it.  I was watching some YouTube videos analyzing the latency differences between current wireless mice and wired mice.  For the first time I think wireless mice are so competitive with wired mice its there is no major reason to be using a wired mouse outside of cost.  The Razer Viper Ultimate is a great example of this.  There may be a valid argument that the Viper 8k has superior performance over the Viper Ultimate Wireless but the mice refresh rate is so far above what most monitors can display at 1000Hz pooling rate It doesn't feel like there is a major reason to be concerned about it.  Not only that but I've heard the processing required to keep track of the cursor at 8000Hz actually drops your in game frame rate by about 3-4 frames per second (depending on your hardware configuration of course).  I don't see the benefit of a 8000Hz pooling rate right now.  In the end I think it's a great time to transition to a wireless mouse if your interested in it and are able to afford it. I purchased the version of the Viper Ultimate which included the dock and I'm glad I did.  The dock has a magnet on it which makes far easier to rest the mouse on the dock in the correct position for it to charge and you really just don't have to think about dropping the mouse on the dock, the convenience is great.  My only complaint about the dock is that it's so light that sometimes I pull up on the mouse and the dock actually lifts off my desk because the magnet is strong enough to carry the weight of the dock for a few seconds before it drops.  I guess the engineers of the mouse decided to add a sticky pad on the bottom of the dock to help with this but I think this is a lame solution.  A weighted dock design would be far superior in my opinion and hopefully it will be included in a future release.  I don't like the thought of a sticky pad on my desk, it might make a gross sticky mess (which thankfully it hasn't) and possibly will become a hard dusty mass in a few years time anyway.  That's really my biggest complaint with the mouse/dock combo. A minor issue I have with the mouse itself is the Teflon feet.  I wish there was a larger Teflon pad at the back end of the mouse, or maybe two separate feet that are larger that covers that back end area a bit better.  In the past I've used mice for years and years on end before replacing them and the back end of the mouse get's the most feet pad wear (at least for me).  I feel like the Viper Ultimate may not last as long just because the back end feet are not significant enough and they are positioned far to the sides of the mouse, to the point I'll be lifting the mouse up off the mousepad surface and then setting it down, back down back end first and dragging the plastic of the mouse on the plastic mousepad surface for a few moments before the Teflon feet make contact with the mousepad.  This is not ideal in my opinion. Razer synapse, I personally don't mind running software in the background for peripherals as long as it doesn't take up too many system resources and Synapse doesn't.  I HATE the way one has to log into an account to make use of some of the features.  No mouse should require one to create an account to make full use of a mouse, that is a garbage idea for user convenience.  I personally think convenience should be prioritized over most aspects of a products design and this causes me anger every time the synapse software asks me for the password that I usually have forgotten in the weeks that go by where I don't have to enter the password.  Even if I tell it to remember my password the Synapse software still asks me for my password from time to time (I think when it does an update).  It's difficult for me to put into words how rage inducing this is, mostly because it feels so unnecessary.  The software should remember your password no matter what, #1 and #2 you should not need to create an account to make use of mouse software, It's trash on two fronts.  Okay, Razer is a business and they feel like they require minor tracking of their customer base so they can make better business decisions and satisfy customers.  I don't like it at all but hypothetically I can understand.  Message to Razer: Make the Synapse software remember your log in info no matter what.  This software design is just as important as your hardware design work.  For over half of the use of my Razer Taipan I didn't use Synapse at all because it was such a pain in the rear end to make sure I'm logged in all the time.  This may indeed only be an issue with the older version of Synapse, so far I haven't had this issue since purchasing the Viper Ultimate.  I really hope Razer has resolved this and I no longer will be plagued with login requests. In the end very few products are perfect and it is hard to fault the Viper Ultimate Wireless with very much.  I think it's a product worth buying and I'm glad I purchased it, I hope it will last me a few years and be a valuable part of my gaming hardware arsenal.  If you are at all on the fence about purchasing this mouse, I wouldn't hesitate too much, its pretty awesome overall.  It is a bit more pricy compared to some wired options but I do prefer wireless over a corded mouse even with a cord bungie (which are really great by the way).  Definitely consider the Viper Ultimate Wireless mouse if your in the market for a mouse, It's a great option in my opinion, despite my complaints.","18 Jun 2021","Color: Classic Black Style: Mouse + Dock","","Yes","Andy Bosold","5.0","Unknown Product","https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Ultimate-Lightweight-Wireless-Charging/product-reviews/B09TG6KG2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
